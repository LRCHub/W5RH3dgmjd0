[00:05.29] Save yourself
[00:08.01] Love is pain, I know too well
[00:11.20] You've never felt
[00:14.16] Waves this strong, just save yourself
[00:17.63] I learned to sink or swim
[00:19.96] But you can't even dive right in
[00:23.32] Save yourself
[00:25.75] If you're drowning in your doubt
[00:28.36] Save yourself
[00:34.86] 
[00:34.98] I'm caught up in a current, babe
[00:37.67] Heartbreak games, you won't play
[00:40.56] It's obvious you don't need me
[00:43.67] That's okay, drift away
[00:55.17] 
[00:46.56] I will trust my fate
[00:48.82] You live your truth
[00:50.31] I will get over it
[00:52.86] It's obvious you don't need me
[00:55.14] That's okay, drift away
[01:06.64] 
[01:03.68] Save yourself
[01:06.56] Love is pain, I know too well
[01:09.60] You've never felt
[01:12.32] Waves this strong, just save yourself
[01:15.78] I learned to sink or swim
[01:17.83] But you can't even dive right in
[01:21.48] Save yourself
[01:23.46] If you're drowning in your doubt
[01:26.23] Save yourself
[01:32.73] 
[01:40.07] You're running from a hurricane
[01:43.07] I set fire to the rain
[01:46.56] I wanna be your lifeline, babe
[01:48.76] I've got time and you got brave
[02:04.26] 
[01:52.07] I will trust my fate
[01:53.86] You live your truth
[01:55.37] I will get over it
[01:57.93] It's obvious you don't need me, no
[02:01.79] Can you hear me (can you hear me, can you?)
[02:23.29] 
[02:03.33] Save yourself
[02:06.15] Love is pain, I know too well
[02:08.85] You've never felt (never felt)
[02:11.79] Waves this strong, just save yourself
[02:15.43] I learned to sink or swim
[02:17.82] But you can't even dive right in
[02:20.74] Save yourself
[02:23.30] If you're drowning in your doubt, save yourself
[02:30.99] If you're drowning in your doubt, just save yourself
[02:56.99] 
[02:46.78] (Drownin' in your doubt)
[02:49.02] (Save, save)
[02:55.02] 
[02:50.33] Save yourself
[02:52.83] Love is pain, I know too well
[02:55.71] You've never felt
[02:58.50] Waves this strong, just save yourself
[03:02.02] I learned to sink or swim
[03:04.24] But you can't even dive right in
[03:07.48] Save yourself
[03:09.95] If you're drowning in your doubt
[03:12.23] Save yourself
