Save yourself
Love is pain, I know too well
You've never felt
waves this strong
Just save yourself
I learned to sink or swim,
but you can't even dive
right in
Save yourself
If you're drowning in your doubt
Save yourself
I'm caught up in a current pave
Heartbreak games, you won't play
It's obvious you don't need me
That's okay, drift away
I will trust my fate
You live your truth
I will get over it
It's obvious you don't need me
That's okay, drift away
Save yourself
Love is pain, I know too well
You've never felt waves
this strong
Just save yourself
I learned to sink or swim,
but you can't even dive right in
Save yourself
If you're drowning in your doubt
Save yourself
You're running from a hurricane
I set fire to the rain
I wanna be your lifeline babe
I've got time and you got brave
I will trust my fate
You live your truth
I will get over it
It's obvious you
don't need me, no
(can you hear me)
(can you hear me)
(can you hear me)
Save yourself
Love is pain I know too well
You've never felt waves
this strong
Just save yourself
I learned to sink or swim
but you can't even dive right in
Save yourself
If you're drowning in your doubt
Save yourself
If you're drowning in your doubt
Just save yourself Save yourself
Love is pain, I know too well
You've never felt
waves this strong
Just save yourself
I learned to sink or swim,
but you can't even dive right
in Save yourself
If you're drowning in your doubt
